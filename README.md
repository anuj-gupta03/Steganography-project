# Steganography-project
This steganography project is a Python application with a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to hide secret messages within images and later extract them. The program uses the least significant bit (LSB) technique, where it converts the user's text message into binary code and then embeds these bits into the least significant bits of the image pixels, making the changes virtually imperceptible to the human eye. The GUI, built with tkinter, provides a user-friendly interface with buttons to browse for images, input text messages, hide messages in selected images, and extract hidden messages from steganographic images. The application uses the PIL (Python Imaging Library) and NumPy libraries to handle image processing, converting images to arrays for manipulation, and includes error handling for common issues like selecting invalid files or attempting to hide messages that are too long for the chosen image. When hiding a message, the modified image is saved as a new PNG file, and when extracting, the hidden message is displayed in the application's text area.
